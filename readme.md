# Paul's Portfolio
## HW Assignment 2

This is my first professional website portfolio. I made it so I can show employers my skills and capaibilites. Although there is not much material on it now, I will continuously add to it throughout the bootcamp. 

What I added this time from HW1 is that now it is responsive to many viewpoints. I used bootstrap to create a more easily outlined webpage. 

# Layout 

* About Me Page
    * A quick bio about me

* Portfolio
    * A page where I will display all of my future porjects. I used cards from bootstrap including four different random image generators. 

* Contact Page  
    * A form that allows people to contact me. This page gave me the most struggle as I tried to style it over the underlying bootstrap code. 

# My Thought Process

My thought process for this portfolio was very simple. Because we only got to use html and css in HW1, I no longer felt limited to the things I could do in this assingment. I felt that bootstrap made it so much easier to create a portfolio, but at the same time it was very hard to be original in the layout. I have some visions that I can't really implement with even bootstrap. My hope is that I will be able to make the portfolio webpage I want once I master javascript. 

# What I Learned

From HW1:

I learned that organizing your code is crucial. I got to a point where I had a lot of bugs, and instead of debugging every individual component, I found it easier to just start over. Getting a piece of paper and actually drawing what you envision your website to be, befroe even writing a single line of code was very benficial for me. Besides that, I learned if I have any trouble or questions, just google it, then copy and paste. 

From HW2:

I learned that bootstrap is amazing. It really makes it easy to just copy and paste and then create a whole layout. However, I learned that styling on top of the given bootstrap is very difficult.
